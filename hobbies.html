    <h2> Hobbies &amp; Interests </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> I'm an avid badminton player who used to compete provincially. I've lead my school team to third place in the province and even won a few tournaments here and there. </li>
        <li> I enjoy working out weekly for both my physical and mental health. </li>
        <li> I love martial arts! I've done Muay Thai and Boxing. </li>
        <li> Music is one of the most important things in my life. I used to play clarinet in my school band and jazz club. I can also play a bit of guitar. I love many genres of music like Jpop, R&B, Jazz, and many more. </li>
        <li> Eating delicious meals and enjoying desserts is what I live for, and I also like to cook when I have time! </li>
    </ul>
