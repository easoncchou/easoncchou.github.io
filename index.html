    <h2> About Me </h2>
    Hello! I'm Eason Chou, a third year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I enjoy coding and making projects, especially when I can see the fruits of my labour! I've currently taken a keen interest in front-end development, but I'm also fascinated by embedded systems, machine learning, and computer science/engineering in general. I have other interests which you can read about in my Hobbies &amp; Interests section.

    <h3> Fun Facts </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> I've made the Dean's Honour List four semesters in a row and counting! (CGPA: 3.67, ~82% average) </li>
        <li> I was also a bronze medalist in the B.C. Provincial Badminton Championships </li>
    </ul>
